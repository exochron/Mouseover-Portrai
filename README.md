# Mouseover Portrai

This addon adds a unit frame for mouseover units to get fast information about an unit without targeting them. The additional unit frame looks like the default target or focus frame with similar features.

Additional to the default tooltip it is possible to see the current cast or the target of the mouseover unit.
